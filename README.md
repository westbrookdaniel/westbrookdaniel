# Daniel Westbrook, Web Developer

Hi, I'm Daniel Westbrook and I am a web developer primarily working with React building next-gen apps. I enjoy creating performant solutions and exploring new tools and technologies.

Some of my favourite things are Remix, TailwindCSS, and Typescript. When I'm not coding you can find me playing sport (tennis and hockey), video games, or listening to music.
