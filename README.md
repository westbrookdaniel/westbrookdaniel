# Hi, I'm Daniel

Checkout my [website](https://westbrookdaniel.com/). I spend most of my time coding React and NodeJS, but I have a lot of projects and here are a few I find interesting:

- [My personal website made with Eleventy](https://github.com/westbrookdaniel/website)
- [A complete template I made for using Fastify](https://github.com/westbrookdaniel/api-template)
- [DocumentX, a client and server framework I made that my website used to be built with](https://github.com/westbrookdaniel/documentx)
- [Some of my advent of code solutions](https://github.com/westbrookdaniel/advent-of-code)

Although I have many more frameworks, libraries, and web apps in various stages of completion.
